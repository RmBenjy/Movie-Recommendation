# Movie Recommendation System with Streamlit Application

This project consists of a movie recommendation system implemented in Python, with an interactive user interface created using Streamlit.

## Overview

The project utilizes the "MovieLens 100K Dataset" from Kaggle to build a personalized movie recommendation system. The system incorporates both exploratory data analysis (EDA) and a correlation-based collaborative filtering mechanism to provide insightful recommendations based on user behavior and specific movie attributes.

## Features

### 1. EDA

Delved deep into features such as movie titles and user ratings to derive critical insights on trends and preferences. The exploratory data analysis helps in understanding the underlying patterns in user behavior and movie characteristics.

### 2. Recommendation Logic

Implemented a correlation-based collaborative filtering mechanism that considers both user behavior and specific movie attributes. This recommendation logic helps in generating personalized movie suggestions for users based on their preferences and viewing history.

### 3. Streamlit Application

Integrated the recommendation system into a Streamlit application, allowing users to interactively explore and receive movie recommendations. The user-friendly interface enhances the overall user experience, making it easy for users to input their preferences and receive personalized suggestions.
