# Movie Recommendation
This project consists of a movie recommendation system using python.

By leveraging the "MovieLens 100K Dataset" from Kaggle, this project aims to personalize movie suggestions.

Features:

    - EDA: Delved deep into features such as movie title and user ratings to derive critical insights on trends and preferences.
    - Recommendation Logic: Implemented a correlation-based collaborative filtering mechanism that takes into account both user behavior and specific movie attributes.
